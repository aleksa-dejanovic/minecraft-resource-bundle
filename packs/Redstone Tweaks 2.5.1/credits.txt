---------------------------------------------------------- THANK YOU ----------------------------------------------------------

  ...for downloading my Resource Pack!

  I put a lot of passion and effort into creating Redstone Tweaks, so if you decide to use it in your online content (YouTube
  videos, Twitch streams etc.) I'd be really grateful if you could give me a shout-out or a short mention.
  If you want to support me, simply paste the following text into your description:

  Resource Pack: Redstone Tweaks by RexxStone

----------------------------------------------------------- CREDITS -----------------------------------------------------------

  Redstone Tweaks is a massive project! Naturally, I took some inspiration and used textures, models and blockstate files from
  other creators. Go check them all out!

---------------------------------------------------- RESOURCE PACK OPTIONS ----------------------------------------------------
